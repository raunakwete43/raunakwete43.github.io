## What is MCP?

MCP stands for Model Context Protocol. Think of it as a universal language that lets AI agents and models talk to each other, regardless of their underlying architecture or platform. Imagine you have a chatbot, a recommendation engine, and a document summarizer—all built with different frameworks. MCP acts as the bridge, making sure they can exchange information seamlessly.

**Why does this matter?** Because interoperability is the future. As AI systems become more complex, the ability to connect diverse models and agents is crucial for building robust, scalable solutions.

## Why Should You Care About MCP?

- **Plug-and-Play AI:** Integrate new models or agents without rewriting your entire codebase.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale your AI infrastructure as your needs grow.
- **Community and Standards:** MCP is gaining traction, so learning it now puts you ahead of the curve.

## Setting Up Your Own MCP Server

Let’s get our hands dirty! Here’s a step-by-step guide to building a basic MCP server in Python. (Don’t worry, you don’t need to be a Python guru to follow along.)

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- MCP SDK

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install mcp mcp[cli]
```

### 3. Create the MCP Server Skeleton

Create a file called `server.py`:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create an MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("Weather Service")


# Tool implementation
@mcp.tool()
def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get the current weather for a specified location."""
    return f"Weather in {location}: Sunny, 24°C"


# Resource implementation
@mcp.resource("weather://{location}")
def weather_resource(location: str) -> str:
    """Provide weather data as a resource."""
    return f"Weather data for {location}: Sunny, 24°C"


# Prompt implementation
@mcp.prompt()
def weather_report(location: str) -> str:
    """Create a weather report prompt."""
    return f"""You are a weather reporter. Weather report for {location}?"""


# Run the server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()

```

### 4. Run Your Server

```bash
mcp dev server.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:6274` to see the interactive API docs generated by FastAPI.

### 5. Inspect using MCP Inspector

When running `mcp dev` it will open the MCP Inspector in the web window which can be used to test the MCP server you have created.

## How Does This Work?

- The MCP communicates with 2 protocols:
  1. **STDIO**:
    The stdio transport is used for local communication, where the Client and Server run on the same machine

  2. **HTTP + SSE**:
    The HTTP+SSE transport is used for remote communication, where the Client and Server might be on different machines
